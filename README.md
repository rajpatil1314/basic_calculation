01.Write a script to declare a variable name and assign it your name. Display the value of the variable using console.log.

02.Declare a variable age and assign it your age. Then, change the value of age to 5 years older. Print both the original and updated values.

03.Declare two variables, firstName and lastName. Assign them your first and last name respectively. Concatenate them into a single variable fullName and print it.

04.Declare a variable num and assign it the value 10. Multiply it by 5 and print the result.

05.Declare two variables, x and y, and assign them the values 8 and 3 respectively. Compute and print the result of x + y, x - y, x * y, and x / y.
06.Declare a variable temperature with an initial value of 20. Reassign it to a string value "twenty degrees". Print the variable before and after reassignment to observe type coercion.

07.Declare a variable value and assign it the string "10". Add 5 to this variable and print the result. What do you observe? Explain why it happens.
08.Create two variables, a and b, and assign them the values 15 and 4 respectively. Use the modulo operator to find the remainder when a is divided by b. Print the result.

09.Declare a variable counter and initialize it to 0. Use the increment operator to increase its value by 1 three times, printing the value after each increment.

10.Declare three variables, p, q, and r, and assign them the values 5, 10, and 15 respectively. Calculate the result of the expression (p + q) * r / q - p and print it.

11.Declare a variable result and assign it the value 10. Multiply it by 2, then subtract 5, and finally add 7. Print the final value.

12.Declare four variables, m, n, o, and p, and assign them the values 2, 4, 6, and 8 respectively. Evaluate and print the result of the expression ((m + n) * o) / (p - m).

13.Write a script that declares a variable score with a value of 85. Use a combination of comparison and logical operators to check if score is greater than 80 and less than 90. Print true or false based on the condition.

14.Create a variable basePrice and assign it the value 100. Declare another variable discount and assign it the string "10%". Convert the discount to a number and calculate the discounted price. Print the final price.

15.Write a script that concatenates a number and a string. For example, combine the number 5 and the string " apples" to form "5 apples". Print the result.

16.Declare variables x and y with initial values 10 and 20. Swap their values without using a third variable. Print the variables before and after swapping.

17.Create a variable total and assign it the value 50. Use the compound assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, and %=) to modify total through a series of operations. Print the value of total after each operation.

18.Write a script that prompts the user to enter their name and age. Store these values in variables and display a greeting message like "Hello, [Name]. You are [Age] years old!".

19.Create a small program that asks the user to input two numbers and then prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

20.Write a script that asks the user to input their age. If the age is greater than or equal to 18, print "You are eligible to vote." Otherwise, print "You are not eligible to vote."

21.Create a program that prompts the user for two numbers. If both numbers are positive, calculate and print their average. If either number is negative, print an error message instead.
